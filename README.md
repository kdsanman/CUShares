# CUShares
The main purpose of this web app is to help other Columbia University students find loanable articles that they need at the moment. For example, say you need a charger for your computer, but you don't have one with you. With this web app, you could search tweets using Twitter's API for people that have posted that they have a charger available to lend.
Based on the location of the tweets and your location, you could reply or DM the author of the tweet that corresponds to the article and arrange the exchange for a pre-specified amount of time.
